Cost sharing refers to that portion of the total costs of a sponsored project borne by the university. To qualify as cost sharing, a cost must be:
1.  verifiable from the university's records;
2.  necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of the project or program objective; and
3. allowable under Federal cost principles and administrative regulations.

All committed (mandatory as well as committed voluntary) cost sharing must be adequately documented in the university's records.
