The rationale for including Cost Share in the proposal budget.

REQUIRED BY SPONSOR: Sponsor has a written requirement in the solicitation or other document requiring all proposals to include Cost Share.  This includes Cost Sharing required by Federal Agency salary caps.

VOLUNTARY: Sponsor does not require Cost Share in the proposal.  Cost Share is being included to enhance the proposal's competitiveness.  All Voluntary Cost Share must be approved beforehand by the department, college and/or institute committing the cost share and be approved by OSP.
