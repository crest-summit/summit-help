Field defaults to "Full Indirect" to indicate no further justification is required when the Federally Negotiated rate is used.  If the Indirect Type is not one of the Federally Negotiated Rates, one of the following justifications must be indicated:

- FULL INDIRECT: The Federally Negotiated Rate is used and no further justification is required.
- WAIVED OR PARTIAL WAIVER - UNIVERSITY DECISION: A department or college has agreed to waive their portion of the indirect so that a lower indirect rate may be charged to the sponsor.  OSP requires documentation of this approval.
- REDUCED INDIRECT - SPONSOR POLICY: The sponsor requires the use of an indirect rate lower than the Federally Negotiated rate.  OSP requires documentation of this requirement either in the solicitation or other sponsor document.
- NOT ALLOWED - SPONSOR POLICY: The sponsor does not allow indirect to be charged to the project.  OSP requires documentation of this requirement either in the solicitation or other sponsor document.
