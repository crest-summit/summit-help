Internal estimate of the percentage of credit for each Virginia Tech investigator on this project (percent credit pertains only to VT faculty) and when summed across all personnel, should total to 100%.  If there is only one (1) PI with no Co-PIâ€™s, then the PI credit will be 100%.  When a PI has dual appointment, it is possible to split the percent of credit between them.  The percent of credit is NOT the same thing as the percent of time the PI will work on the Project.  The percent credit may or may not correspond to the proposed budget or to activity reported on the Personnel Activity reports (PARs).  The percent of credit is used by the University to determine the relative participation of the faculty in various research endeavors
