The date by which the proposal should be submitted to the Sponsor in cases when there is no official Sponsor Deadline or when the PI would like it submitted earlier than the Sponsor Deadline.  This date is taken from the "When would you like to submit" question on the initiator.  If it was indicated that the proposal would not be submitted before the Sponsor Deadline, this field defaults to the Sponsor Deadline. NOTE:  Notices from OSP will be triggered from this date.
