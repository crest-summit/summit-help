Engaging in non-fundamental research creates intersection with export control laws such as the ITAR and places students graduate thesis work at risk, as well as their ability to graduate. Export controlled, non-fundamental research projects require the establishment of a Technology Control Plan, export control training for all researchers, and implementation of security measures to protect the research results from inadvertent disclosure to unauthorized personnel.
