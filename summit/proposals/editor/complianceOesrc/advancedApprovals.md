- Public Release / Publication:  See above for definition
- Fundamental Research Exclusion: Fundamental research is excluded from the licensing requirements of the export control regulations and is defined to mean basic and applied research in science and engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from research the results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons or specific U.S. Government access and dissemination controls. University research will not be considered fundamental research if:
  - The University or its researchers accept other restrictions on publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project or activity, or
  - The research is funded by the U.S. Government and specific access and dissemination controls protecting information resulting from the research are applicable
- Export Controls: Engaging in non-fundamental research creates intersection with export control laws such as the ITAR and places students graduate thesis work at risk, as well as their ability to graduate. Export controlled, non-fundamental research projects require the establishment of a Technology Control Plan, export control training for all researchers, and implementation of security measures to protect the research results from inadvertent disclosure to unauthorized personnel.
