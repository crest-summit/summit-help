- Public Release / Publication:  See above for definition
- Fundamental Research Exclusion: Fundamental research is excluded from the licensing requirements of the export control regulations. University research will not be considered fundamental research if:
  - The University accepts restrictions on publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the project, or
  - The research is funded by the U.S. Government and publication restrictions are applicable
- Export Controls: Laws applying to non-fundamental research such as the ITAR. Export controlled, non-fundamental research projects require the establishment of a Technology Control Plan, export control training for all researchers, and implementation of security measures. Such restrictions may place graduate thesis work at risk.
