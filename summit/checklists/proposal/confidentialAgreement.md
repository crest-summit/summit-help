When the university and potential research partners share information with each other that each party considers either proprietary or confidential, information exchanges between parties may be formalized in an agreement to prevent inadvertent disclosures to third parties. These agreements may be called Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDA), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), Proprietary Information Agreement (PIA) or Data Use Agreements (DUA).
