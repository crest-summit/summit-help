Participant Support Costs (PSC) are defined by 2 CFR 200.75 as those costs used to pay program participants small, non-compensatory stipends and possible reimbursement of travel costs of other out-of-pocket costs paid to participants (but not employees) in support of attendance at meetings, conferences, symposia, training activities, workshops and similar events.    PSC do NOT include honoraria for guest speakers, expenses for the PI, project staff or collaborators to attend project meetings, conferences, or seminars, payments to GRAs, or payments made to research subjects as an incentive for recruitment or participation in a research project.  PSC are excluded from the calculation of Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC).
The Uniform Guidance (2 CRF 200) requires prior approval of the Federal Agency in order to incur Participant Support Costs under federally sponsored awards.
