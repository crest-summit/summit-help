Compliance requirements based on your responses

Human Subjects

Approval requirement: Approval is required from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) based on the project's inclusion of human subjects.

Timing of approval: The majority of IRB protocols receive approval within two weeks; however, approval may take two months or longer. If you currently have an approved active IRB protocol for this grant proposal, a new protocol is not required. Provide the IRB number to OSP when requested.

Release of funds requirement: Grant-related funds may not be released until proof of IRB approval is provided to the OSP. In addition, activities involving human subjects may not commence without prior IRB approval. Some funding agencies require an IRB approval letter earlier in the proposal process; therefore, please plan accordingly.

Training requirements: All investigators (and research personnel who will interact with vertebrate animals) must complete human subject protections training (view requirements) prior to the submittal of an IRB protocol for approval.
