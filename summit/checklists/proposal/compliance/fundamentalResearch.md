If the project includes any funding from DOD sponsors or flow-through that is originally from a DOD source, the PI is required to read the OSP 29-05 Attachment A memo from the Office of Export and Secure Research Compliance (OESRC) and determine if the research should be considered Fundamental or not.  OSP should assist the PI in declaring fundamental research in the proposal document (e.g proposal cover letter and/or statement of work).
