Fundamental research is defined to mean basic and applied research where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from research the results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons or specific U.S. Government access and dissemination controls. Engaging in non-fundamental research creates potential intersection with export control laws and may limit foreign national participation and may require export compliance protocols.
