Timing of approval: The IBC meets monthly, and protocols need to be submitted three weeks in advance. As a result, IBC approval may take 6 weeks or longer. If you currently have an approved active IBC protocol for this grant proposal, a new protocol is not required. Provide the IBC number to OSP when requested.

Release of funds requirement: Activities involving biohazardous agents may not commence without prior IBC approval. Some funding agencies require proof that an IBC protocol is in review prior to the release of funds; therefore, please plan accordingly.

Training requirements: All investigators (and personnel who will work in the lab with biohazardous agents) must complete IBC and EHS training [view training requirements](https://www.research.vt.edu/ibc/required-training.html).
