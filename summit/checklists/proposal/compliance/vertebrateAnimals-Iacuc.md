Compliance requirements based on your responses

Vertebrate Animals

Approval requirement: Approval is required from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) based on the project's inclusion of vertebrate animals.

Timing of approval: The majority of IACUC protocols receive approval within four to six weeks; however, approval may take two months or longer. If you currently have an approved active IACUC protocol for this grant proposal, a new protocol is not required. Provide the IACUC number to OSP when requested.

Release of funds requirement: Grant-related funds may not be released until proof of IACUC approval is provided to the OSP. In addition, activities involving vertebrate animals may not commence without prior IACUC approval. Some funding agencies require an IACUC approval letter earlier in the proposal process; therefore, please plan accordingly.

Training requirements: All investigators (and research personnel who will interact with vertebrate animals) must complete IACUC training [view requirements](https://www.research.vt.edu/iacuc/training.html) prior to the submittal of an IACUC protocol for approval.
