**Default Research Organization**

Are you associated with many different organizations, but primarily conduct research for just one? If so, set your default research organization to make things easier: 

- As a PI, your submitting organization will be pre-populated with your specified default research organization.

- As a Co-PI, support staff for your default research organization will be automatically added to the work.

Don't worry, you can always change your submitting organization and support staff for each individual work item. But setting your default research organization helps save you some work.
